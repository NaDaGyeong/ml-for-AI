        "In this notebook version 14, we show you how to process Kaggle's train data and train a model using Kaggle's train data. This is an exciting accomplishment. Currently, as of today, all public notebooks better than LB 0.200 **do not use** Kaggle train data. Instead they use models and techniques from the internet to predict mutation stability. In this notebook we use only Kaggle train and achieve LB 0.30+\n",

        "The notebook you are reading is the first notebook to use only Kaggle train data and score over LB 0.200! (It achieves LB 0.307 single model). Many Kagglers have contributed to making this a success! Including Robert Hatch, GreySnow, Rope on Mars, Vladimir Slaykovskiy, Jinyuan Sun, Kaggleqrdl, Lucas Morin, Moth! It is quite tricky to utilize Kaggle's train data. The process is explained in detail [here][5] and summarized in the diagram below:\n",

        "In previous notebook versions, we built a pipeline to train XGB using features extracted from protein sequence and structure. Also in previous notebook versions, we demonstrated how to download and use external data. In notebook version 13 we added transformer embedding features. In notebook version 11, we download 5000 Single Point Mutations and 200 PDB files from Jinyuan Sun's GitHub [here][1] and discussion [here][4]. We then train a model to predict `dTm` from single point mutations with `dTm` targets and achieve 5-Fold CV Spearman correlation coefficient 0.26 on `dTm`. Next we use this model to predict a holdout dataset's `ddG` and achieve Spearman correlation coefficient 0.26 on `ddG`. Finally we predict Kaggle's test data using this model and achieve LB 0.192. In notebook version 12, we train with both dTm and ddG targets (mixed together) and achieve dTm CV 0.194, ddG CV 0.460, LB 0.209. Notebook version 13 achieves single model LB 0.3! In notebook version 13, we submit the ensemble of versions 8, 11, 12, and 13 and achieve LB 0.34!\n",
        "\n",
        "An advantage of dowloading data is that we can train with PDB files and then utilize Kaggle's PDB test file during inference. But note we train with PDB files from Protein Data Bank and Kaggle provides PDB file from Alpha Fold for inference. These PDB files were **not** created in the same way. See discussion [here][2]. In order to have inference match training, we load our own test data wild type PDB file created from the internet as described [here][3]. This new PDB file has `b_factor` more similar to the real `b_factor` that we train on. However `atom_df` rows containing Hydrogen atoms are still different (between AlphaFold PDBs and Protein Data Bank PDBs), so be careful with feature engineering. If we submit this real `b_factor` (which isn't Alpha Fold's `pLDDT`) it scores LB 0.139 by itself. Our XGB model achieves a better LB, so it means that our model is learning something!\n",

        "# Notes\n",
        "This notebook is a work in progress. The most helpful aspects of this notebook is that it shows (1) how to use Kaggle's train data, (2) how to extract features from ESM transformer, and (3) how to download 5000 more mutations from the internet and their corresponding 200 PDB files. Specifically 4000 of these mutations, have `ddG` targets and 1000 of these mutations have `dTm` targets. We must decide how to best use this external data and the two types of targets. Furthermore we must be careful training with Protein Data Bank PDB and inferring with AlphaFold PDB. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **Versions 1-6** use Kaggle's PDB with `b_factor` column different than Protein Data Bank's PDB `b_factor` column, so we can ignore those `submission.csv`.\n",
        "* **Version 7 LB 0.146** trains/KFold-validates on `ddG` and holdout-validates on `dTM` and uses an updated PDB for inference with a `b_factor` column that is similar to training data. However many features still do not transfer well from train PDB to infer PDB because the Protein Data Bank's PDB `atom_df` dataframe excludes many hydrogen atoms. Therefore feature engineering needs to be updated. We need to only use rows with `atom_name` isin `['N','H','CA','O']` when counting atoms and/or creating features from `x_coord`, `y_coord`, `z_coord`. (Discussion [here][2])\n",
        "* **Version 8 LB 0.173** trains/Kfold-validates on `dTm` and holdout-validates on `ddG`. Uses correct `b_factor` in both train and infer. Uses features that don't work well for train and infer (because of atom PDB differences). Furthermore Version 8 model scores LB 0.173 by itself, but Version 8 notebook submits a 50/50 ensemble of version 7 and version 8 which has benefits of train on both `ddG` and `ddT` and achieves LB 0.196.\n",
        "* **Version 9-11 LB LB 0.192**  trains/Kfold-validates on `dTm` and holdout-validates on `ddG`. Achieves CV 0.260 on both targets. Uses features that exclude hydrogen atoms in PDB since Alpha Fold PDB `atom_df` contains more hydrogen atom rows than corresponding Protein Data Bank PDBs. Also uses features that should be stable between train and test. \n",
        "* **Version 12 LB 0.209** trains/Kfold-validates on all 5000 mutations! It trains with mixture of rank normalized `dTm` and `ddG` targets. Achieves CV 0.194 on `dTM` proteins and CV 0.460 on `ddG` proteins. Uses same features as versions 9-11 (but more train data and both targets). Furthermore Version 12 model scores LB 0.209 by itself, but Version 12 notebook submits a 33/33/33 ensemble of version 8, 11, 12 and achieves LB 0.298 woohoo!\n",
        "* **Version 13 LB 0.300** trains/Kfold-validates on all 5000 mutations! It trains with mixture of rank normalized `dTm` and `ddG` targets. Achieves CV 0.233 on `dTM` proteins and CV 0.619 on `ddG` proteins. Amazing `ddG` CV score! Uses same features as versions 12-13 and adds additional transformer embedding features. Furthermore Version 14 model scores LB 0.300 by itself! but Version 14 notebook submits a 50/50 ensemble of version 12 and 14 and achieves LB ???\n",
        "* **Version 14 LB 0.307** Woohoo! We finally trained a model and achieved a good CV LB using only Kaggle train data. This is a huge milestone which took collaboration from many Kagglers and 2 weeks of time. This single model achieves CV 0.34 LB 0.31. The LB score posted on version 14 is better than 0.31 because it is the ensemble of notebook version 14 with previous notebook versions 13, 12, 11, 8, and 7. Each previous version adds diversity by training with different data and/or features.\n",
        "* **Version 15** In version 15 which has not been created yet, we plan to demonstrate how to use ESM transformer to create mutation probability features and entropy features! Stay tuned...\n",

        "Below is 3D plot of Kaggle's test data protein structure from PDB file rendered by py3Dmol (with docs [here][1]). For each of our 5000 mutation downloaded train data, we also have protein structure since we downloaded 200 PDB files from Protein Data Bank. And when using Kaggle train data, we now have PDB files! Therefore when we feature engineer, we can create features from both protein sequence, protein structure, and amino acids. In this notebook, we use the following features:\n",
        "* Protein Structure features (from atom positions in PDB file)\n",
        "* Protein Sequence features\n",
        "* Amino Acid features \n",
